# Space Image Enhancement
Using Star Enhancement techniques on Planet Images

Image of Apollo 12 astronaut on the "Moon", combination of 37 images from low resolution video, cropped to a wide angle format.

Note the flat nature of the landscape, the square format of ground features. Multiple track ways, from tracked digger. A thin wheeled cart track is seen quickly disappearing to the horizon.

Further work : enhance size further and process colour information.
